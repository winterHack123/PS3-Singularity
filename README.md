## A Web-UI Renovation Project for the Winter Hackathon

This project is written in pure CSS,HTML and JavaScript and is made with the purpose to make an attempt in providing an improved UI for the NIT Goa Webiste

## Developed by Team Singularity

We as members of Team Singularity have created this project for the first Winter Hackathon of NIT Goa conducted from 4th December to 5th December. The problem statement in our hand was to re-imagine and re-create a UI that reinvents the way NIT Goa represents itself in the world of web. We realized that though quite useful, the website had its own de-merits and hence we decided to work on it as hard as possible, resulting in this simple UI project that might be a useful solution for the betterment of the institute's website.

Though a bit primitive, we believe that creating a UI in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript has given some control that other frameworks couldn't provide. Hence, we present to you this project and would like to further hear from your end about this.

For the pie chart we had used a simple fork of [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org).
